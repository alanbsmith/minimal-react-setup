# Minimal React Setup

### Up & Running

**NOTE:** _This doesn't run in Chrome, but Firefox works great._
```
git clone https://github.com/alanbsmith/minimal-react-setup.git
cd minimal-react-setup
open index.html -a firefox
```

You can write all your components in `index.js` and add your styles in `base.css`. Some CDN tags in the head of `index.html` are commented out as they are not essential. Feel free to uncomment them to add jQuery, Bootstrap, and Bootswatch as needed.
